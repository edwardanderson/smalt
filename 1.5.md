  * "To make Blew-Japan. This task calls for several ingredients, and those too diversly prepared, before they can be admitted to the composition. In the front white-lead appears, which must be ground with Gum-water very finely on a Marble-stone. The next in rank is some of the best and finest Smalt, (to be met with in the colour-shops,) which you must mix with Isinglass-size; adding, of your white-lead so grinded, a quantity proportionable to the Blew you intermix with ‘em, or as you would have it be in strength of body. All these well stirred and temper’d together, being arrived to the consistence and thickness of common Paint, wash over your work with it, and, when perfectly dry, do the like three or four times, until you observe your Blew lies with a good fair body; if it should so fall out, that the Blew should be too pale and weak, put more Smalt, and no white-lead into your size. Having rush’t it very smooth strike it over again with this stronger Blew: soon after, yet not till it is very dry, with a clean pencil give it, at two several times, as many washings with the clearest Isinglass-size alone; and lay it aside for two days carefully covered, to preserve it from dust: the same diligence forget not in making White-japan, which does as absolutely require a covering, until either of them is secured by a proper mantle of their own, varnish, which is sufficient to guard ‘em against all injuries of dust or dirt. But to proceed: when you have warmed it by the fire, imploy again your cleanest pencil, dipt in a small portion of white-varnish, anointing your work seven or eight times; desist then for one day or two, after which was it again as often as before. Lay it aside for the same space of time, which being expired, repeat your washes the third and last time, as often as formerly. So many operations certainly deserve some leisure minuts, and a week at least must be pass’d over, before you dare presume to polish it. When that is done, with Lamblack and oyl clear it up, and lend it a glissening, smooth, and pleasant countenance. Observe, that your blews being more deep and dark, thin or pale, depends wholly upon the different quantities of white-lead, that are mixt with the Smalt after the first washes: for as a small proportion of Lead introduces the first, so a greater plenty occasions the latter. Let this serve for a general caution in laying either Blews, White, or any other colours with isinglass-size; let it not be too strong, but rather on the contrary very weak, but just sufficient to bind your colours, or make them stick on your work: for if it be otherwise, it will be apt to crack and flie off. But last of all, when you lay or wash with clear Isinglass, to keep your varnish from soaking into, or tarnishing your colours, then let it be of a strong and full body."

      * "Painted Wood: History and Conservation, ieds. Valerie Dorge, F. Carey Howlett: mentions that sometimes coloured varnishes would be used to create striking effect. There is an example of a 1730 clock in which this blue japan is covered with a golden varnish to produce a green-ish hue. further on (p334) also describes smalt being used as a constituent of a coloured varnish"
