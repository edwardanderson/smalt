All these well stirred and temper’d together, being arrived to the consistence and thickness of common Paint, wash over your work with it, and, when perfectly dry, do the like three or four times, until you observe your Blew lies with a good fair body; if it should so fall out, that the Blew should be too pale and weak, put more Smalt, and no white-lead into your size. Having rush’t it very smooth strike it over again with this stronger Blew: soon after, yet not till it is very dry, with a clean pencil give it, at two several times, as many washings with the clearest Isinglass-size alone; and lay it aside for two days carefully covered, to preserve it from dust: the same diligence forget not in making White-japan, which does as absolutely require a covering, until either of them is secured by a proper mantle of their own, varnish, which is sufficient to guard ‘em against all injuries of dust or dirt.

Let this serve for a general caution in laying either Blews, White, or any other colours with isinglass-size; let it not be too strong, but rather on the contrary very weak, but just sufficient to bind your colours, or make them stick on your work: for if it be otherwise, it will be apt to crack and flie off.
